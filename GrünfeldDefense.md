# Grünfeld Defense

### The Grünfeld Defence is a chess opening characterised by the moves: . 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5. Black offers White the possibility of 4.cxd5, which may be followed by 4...Nxd5 and 5.e4, giving White an imposing central pawn duo. If White does not take the d5-pawn, Black may eventually play ...dxc4, when a White response of e4 again leads to the same pawn structure.
